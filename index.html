            <p> I am Nishi Mahato. I go by Nishi. From the very beginning in my career I have a knack of getting to the bottom of things and researching topics of my interest has always been very exciting to me. My work experience at HCL technology for CISCO client has been a great learning curve. Getting CCNA certification was a prerequisite for the project and I felt proud when I got my CCNA certification in first attempt in 2 weeks after getting the project assigned to me. I learnt a lot about network switches and explored much more than just what my job warranted me to know to in order to perform my daily task. I was chosen as a rising star due to my quick learning abilities and grasp on the product in such a short span. </p>
            <br>
            <p> This was just an example where my acquisitive quality came to the fore and helped me not to just move forward but also kept me hungry to learn new things. I have recently picked up learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I practice sample project and always try to implement small programs to build a strong foundation.  </p>
